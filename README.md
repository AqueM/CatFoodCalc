# CatFoodCalc
This project is aiming to teach the contributors hands-on knowledge and skills in coding and CI by 
creating a web-based application that allows a user to calculate a cat's basic needs 
and how to fulfill them.

## Roadmap
### Phase 1
Take basic cat data from user input and return caloric needs for the cat. 
### Phase 2
Take basic food data from user input and rate it in terms of caloric and nutritional density.
### Phase 3
Compare data from phase 1 and 2 and suggest how much of the cat food a given cat should eat daily.

## Requirements
* Python 3

Currently no user input accepted, and as such, you can only run it from console by using test code. 
Subject to change in phase 1.
